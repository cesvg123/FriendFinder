Hello...

I was able to complete most of the homework except for the friend matching. I shall continue working on it the next few days hoping to update this readme.

Please look at the video where you shall see the end-to-end application working. I did not spend much time working on the CSS because I wanted to get it all working and then work on the css. Hoping I could get it all working and looking nice in the next few days.

Regards,
Cesar
